Finance chart analysis: Stock market vs. Crypto

We want to compare the trend of stock prices vs. crypto currencies. 
It is often said, that crypto currencies are not strongly bound to the finance markets. 
This would have the benefit that investors can buy both values to have a better diversification.

We will try these comparison approaches:
- visual comparison
- corellation by month
- correlation in total

For getting the finance data we will use the Yahoo! Finance API. 
You can adapt this easily to see other stock values.
